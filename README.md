 As a software developer, I always prioritize bringing value beyond just writing code. With a solid foundation in web development, my primary goal is to add value to companys by helping building valuable solutions that meet their needs.

My approach to every challenges it's use a efficient software developer mentality: breaking a big problem in smaller ones, looking for ways to optimize the result, and so on.

In my vision in software development industry languages are just simply tools. I am always open to connecting with others knowledge fields and learning about new technologies.

Things that I have interested: SRE, DevOps, Cloud Platforms (AWS, GCP, AZURE), Android Development (Kotlin, Java, React Native), UI/UX, Front-End Development
